of lysosome from about 4.5 to 6.5 at 100 μM9. To our knowledge, there is a lack of studies on the impact ofHCQ on the morphology and pH values of endosomes/lysosomes. Our observations suggested that the mode ofactions of CQ and HCQ appear to be distinct in certainaspects.It has been reported that oral absorption of CQ andHCQ in humans is very efﬁcient. In animals, both drugsshare similar tissue distribution patterns, with high con-centrations in the liver, spleen, kidney, and lung reachinglevels of 200–700 times higher than those in the plasma
10. It was reported that safe dosage (6 –6.5 mg/kg per day) of HCQ sulfate could generate serum levels of 1.4 –1.5μMi n humans
11. Therefore, with a safe dosage, HCQ con-centration in the above tissues is likely to be achieved toinhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.Clinical investigation found that high concentration ofcytokines were detected in the plasma of critically illpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting thatcytokine storm was associated with disease severity
12. Other than its direct antiviral activity, HCQ is a safe andsuccessful anti-inﬂammatory agent that has been usedextensively in autoimmune diseases and can signi ﬁcantly decrease the production of cytokines and, in particular,pro-inﬂammatory factors. Therefore, in COVID-19patients, HCQ may also contribute to attenuating theinﬂammatory response. In conclusion, our results showthat HCQ can efﬁciently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infectionin vitro. In combination with its anti-in ﬂammatory func- tion, we predict that the drug has a good potential tocombat the disease. This possibility awaits con ﬁrmation by clinical trials. We need to point out, although HCQ is lesstoxic than CQ, prolonged and overdose usage can stillcause poisoning. And the relatively low SI of HCQ requirescareful designing and conducting of clinical trials to achieveefﬁcient and safe control of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
