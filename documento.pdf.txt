Dear Editor,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome cor-onavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) poses a seriousthreat to global public health and local economies. As ofMarch 3, 2020, over 80,000 cases have been con ﬁrmed in China, including 2946 deaths as well as over 10,566conﬁrmed cases in 72 other countries. Such huge num-bers of infected and dead people call for an urgentdemand of effective, available, and affordable drugs tocontrol and diminish the epidemic.We have recently reported that two drugs, remdesivir(GS-5734) and chloroquine (CQ) phosphate, ef ﬁciently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro
1. Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog prodrug developed by Gilead Sciences(USA). A recent case report showed that treatment withremdesivir improved the clinical condition of the ﬁrst patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the United States
2, and a phase III clinical trial of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 was launched in Wuhan on February 4, 2020.However, as an experimental drug, remdesivir is notexpected to be largely available for treating a very largenumber of patients in a timely manner. Therefore, of thetwo potential drugs, CQ appears to be the drug of choicefor large-scale use due to its availability, proven safetyrecord, and a relatively low cost. In light of the pre-liminary clinical data, CQ has been added to the list oftrial drugs in the Guidelines for the Diagnosis andTreatment of COVID-19 (sixth edition) published byNational Health Commission of the People ’s Republic of China.CQ (N4-(7-Chloro-4-quinolinyl)-N1,N1-diethyl-1,4-pentanediamine) has long been used to treat malaria andamebiasis. However,Plasmodium falciparumdeveloped widespread resistance to it, and with the development ofnew antimalarials, it has become a choice for the pro-phylaxis of malaria. In addition, an overdose of CQ cancause acute poisoning and death3. In the past years, due to infrequent utilization of CQ in clinical practice, its pro-duction and market supply was greatly reduced, at least inChina. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) sulfate, a derivative ofCQ, wasﬁrst synthesized in 1946 by introducing ahydroxyl group into CQ and was demonstrated to bemuch less (~40%) toxic than CQ in animals
4. More importantly, HCQ is still widely available to treat auto-immune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosusand rheumatoid arthritis. Since CQ and HCQ sharesimilar chemical structures and mechanisms of acting as aweak base and immunomodulator, it is easy to conjure upthe idea that HCQ may be a potent candidate to treatinfection by SARS-CoV-2. Actually, as of February 23,2020, seven clinical trial registries were found in ChineseClinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn) for using HCQ to treat COVID-19. Whether HCQ is as ef ﬁcacious as CQ in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection still lacks theexperimental evidence.To this end, we evaluated the antiviral effect of HCQagainst SARS-CoV-2 infection in comparison to CQin vitro. First, the cytotoxicity of HCQ and CQ in Africangreen monkey kidney VeroE6 cells (ATCC-1586) wasmeasured by standard CCK8 assay, and the result showed

To better compare the antiviral activity of CQ versus HCQ,the dose–response curves of the two compounds againstSARS-CoV-2 were determined at four different multi-plicities of infection (MOIs) by quanti ﬁcation of viral RNA copy numbers in the cell supernatant at 48 h postinfection (p.i.). The data summarized in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table S1 show that, at all MOIs (0.01,0.02, 0.2, and 0.8), the 50% maximal effective concentra-tion (EC
50) for CQ (2.71, 3.81, 7.14, and 7.36 μM) was lower than that of HCQ (4.51, 4.06, 17.31, and 12.96 μM). The differences in EC
50values were statistically signiﬁcant at an MOI of 0.01 (P< 0.05) and MOI of 0.2 (P< 0.001) (Supplementary Table S1). It is worth noting that theEC
50values of CQ seemed to be a little higher than that inour previous report (1.13μM at an MOI of 0.05)
1, which is likely due to the adaptation of the virus in cell culturethat signiﬁcantly increased viral infectivity upon con-tinuous passaging. Consequently, the selectivity index(SI=CC
50/EC 50) of CQ (100.81, 71.71, 38.26, and 37.12)was higher than that of HCQ (55.32, 61.45, 14.41, 19.25)at MOIs of 0.01, 0.02, 0.2, and 0.8, respectively. Theseresults were corroborated by immuno ﬂuorescence microscopy as evidenced by different expression levels ofvirus nucleoprotein (NP) at the indicated drug con-centrations at 48 h p.i. (Supplementary Fig. S1). Takentogether, the data suggest that the anti-SARS-CoV-2activity of HCQ seems to be less potent compared to CQ,at least at certain MOIs.Both CQ and HCQ are weak bases that are known toelevate the pH of acidic intracellular organelles, such asendosomes/lysosomes, essential for membrane fusion
5.I n addition, CQ could inhibit SARS-CoV entry throughchanging the glycosylation of ACE2 receptor and spikeprotein
6. Time-of-addition experiment con ﬁrmed that HCQ effectively inhibited the entry step, as well as thepost-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2, which was also foundupon CQ treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2). To furtherexplore the detailed mechanism of action of CQ and HCQin inhibiting virus entry, co-localization of virions withearly endosomes (EEs) or endolysosomes (ELs) was ana-lyzed by immunoﬂuorescence analysis (IFA) and confocalmicroscopy. Quantiﬁcation analysis showed that, at90 min p.i. in untreated cells, 16.2% of internalized virions(anti-NP, red) were observed in early endosome antigen 1(EEA1)-positive EEs (green), while more virions (34.3%)were transported into the late endosomal –lysosomal protein LAMP1+ELs (green) (n> 30 cells for each group). By contrast, in the presence of CQ or HCQ, signi ﬁcantly more virions (35.3% for CQ and 29.2% for HCQ; P< 0.001) were detected in the EEs, while only very few vir-ions (2.4% for CQ and 0.03% for HCQ; P< 0.001) were found to be co-localized with LAMP1
+ELs (n> 30 cells) (Fig.1b, c). This suggested that both CQ and HCQblocked the transport of SARS-CoV-2 from EEs to ELs,which appears to be a requirement to release the viralgenome as in the case of SARS-CoV
7. Interestingly, we found that CQ and HCQ treatmentcaused noticeable changes in the number and size/mor-phology of EEs and ELs (Fig.1c). In the untreated cells, most EEs were much smaller than ELs (Fig. 1c). In CQ- and HCQ-treated cells, abnormally enlarged EE vesicleswere observed (Fig.1c, arrows in the upper panels), manyof which are even larger than ELs in the untreated cells.This is in agreement with previous report that treatmentwith CQ induced the formation of expanded cytoplasmicvesicles
8. Within the EE vesicles, virions (red) were loca-lized around the membrane (green) of the vesicle. CQtreatment did not cause obvious changes in the numberand size of ELs; however, the regular vesicle structureseemed to be disrupted, at least partially. By contrast, inHCQ-treated cells, the size and number of ELs increasedsigniﬁcantly (Fig.1c, arrows in the lower panels).Since acidiﬁcation is crucial for endosome maturationand function, we surmise that endosome maturationmight be blocked at intermediate stages of endocytosis,resulting in failure of further transport of virions to theultimate releasing site. CQ was reported to elevate the pH(seeﬁgure on previous page)Fig. 1 Comparative antiviral ef ﬁcacy and mechanism of action of CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. a Cytotoxicity and antiviral activities of CQ and HCQ. The cytotoxicity of the two drugs in Vero E6 cells was determined by CCK-8 assays. Vero E6 cells were treated withdifferent doses of either compound or with PBS in the controls for 1 h and then infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOIs of 0.01, 0.02, 0.2, and 0.8. The virusyield in the cell supernatant was quanti ﬁed by qRT-PCR at 48 h p.i. Y-axis represents the mean of percent inhibition normalized to the PBS group. The experiments were repeated twice. b,cMechanism of CQ and HCQ in inhibiting virus entry. Vero E6 cells were treated with CQ or HCQ (50 μM) for 1 h, followed by virus binding (MOI=10) at 4 °C for 1 h. Then the unbound virions were removed, and the cells were further supplemented with fresh drug-containing medium at 37 °C for 90 min before being ﬁxed and stained with IFA using anti-NP antibody for virions (red) and antibodies against EEA1 for EEs (green) or LAMP1 for ELs (green). The nuclei (blue) were stained with Hoechst dye. The portion of virions that co-localized with EEs or ELsin each group (n> 30 cells) was quantiﬁed and is shown inb.

Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with GraphPad Prism (F=102.8, df=5,182, ***P< 0.001).Liu et al.Cell Discovery           (2020) 6:16 Page 3 of 4of lysosome from about 4.5 to 6.5 at 100 μM9. To our knowledge, there is a lack of studies on the impact ofHCQ on the morphology and pH values of endosomes/lysosomes. Our observations suggested that the mode ofactions of CQ and HCQ appear to be distinct in certainaspects.It has been reported that oral absorption of CQ andHCQ in humans is very efﬁcient. In animals, both drugsshare similar tissue distribution patterns, with high con-centrations in the liver, spleen, kidney, and lung reachinglevels of 200–700 times higher than those in the plasma
10. It was reported that safe dosage (6 –6.5 mg/kg per day) of HCQ sulfate could generate serum levels of 1.4 –1.5μMi n humans
11. Therefore, with a safe dosage, HCQ con-centration in the above tissues is likely to be achieved toinhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.Clinical investigation found that high concentration ofcytokines were detected in the plasma of critically illpatients infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting thatcytokine storm was associated with disease severity
12. Other than its direct antiviral activity, HCQ is a safe andsuccessful anti-inﬂammatory agent that has been usedextensively in autoimmune diseases and can signi ﬁcantly decrease the production of cytokines and, in particular,pro-inﬂammatory factors. Therefore, in COVID-19patients, HCQ may also contribute to attenuating theinﬂammatory response. In conclusion, our results showthat HCQ can efﬁciently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infectionin vitro. In combination with its anti-in ﬂammatory func- tion, we predict that the drug has a good potential tocombat the disease. This possibility awaits con ﬁrmation by clinical trials. We need to point out, although HCQ is lesstoxic than CQ, prolonged and overdose usage can stillcause poisoning. And the relatively low SI of HCQ requirescareful designing and conducting of clinical trials to achieveefﬁcient and safe control of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
