b'man and animal pathogens. At '
b'he end of December 2019, a no'
b'el coro-navirus was recognize'
b' as the reason of a group of '

b'liminary site to which cases '
b'f coronavirus disease 2019 (C'
b'VID-19) were related, a city '
b'n the Hubei Province of China'
b'(1). The novel coronavirus ha'
b' quickly become widespread, r'
b'sulting in an epidemic throug'
b'out China, followed by a pand'
b'mia, an increasing number of '
b'ases in various countries thr'
b'ughout the world (2). Since t'
b'e first reports of COVID-19, '
b'he infection has spread to co'
b'tain more than 81.552 cases i'
b' China and growing cases (>1.'
b'00.000) worldwide, prompting '
b'he World Health Organization '
b'WHO) to announce a public hea'
b'th emergency in late January '
b'020 and describe it as a pand'
b'mic in March 2020 (3). Curren'
b'ly, as epidemics have develop'
b'd in different nations, escal'
b'ting numbers of cases have al'
b'o been described in other cou'
b'tries from all continents, ex'
b'luding Antarctica. The veloci'
b'y of new cases outside of Chi'
b'a, including the USA, Italy a'
b'd Spain, has overcome the rat'
b' in China. In February 2020, '
b'he WHO named the disease as C'
b'VID-19. The virus that causes'
b'COVID-19 is nominated as seve'
b'e acute respiratory syndrome '
b'oronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); it'
b'was formerly described as 201'
b'-nCoV (the novel coronavirus)'
b'(4).Our aim is here to discus'
b' the COVID-19 disease (SARS-C'
b'V-2 infection) beginning from'
b'virology, epidemiology and co'
b'tinuing with clinical manifes'
b'ations, diagnosis, its compli'

b'ith the SARSCoV (6). The Inte'
b'national Committee on Taxonom'
b' of Viruses has suggested tha'
b' this virus be named SARSCoV-'
b' (7). The constitution of the'
b'receptor-binding gene re-gion'
b'is very like to that of the S'
b'RS-CoV, and the virus has bee'
b' demonstrated to utilize the '
b'ame receptor, the angiotensin'
b'convert-ing enzyme 2 (ACE2), '
b'or entrance into respiratory '
b'ells (8). Re-cent studies hav'
b' demonstrated that the SARS-C'
b'V-2 originated from untamed a'
b'imals, e.g., bats, the interm'
b'diary animals (such as pangol'
b'ns and snakes) through which '
b't crossed over to humans are '
b'ndecided. EpidemiologyIn the '
b'eginning, an association with'
b'a seafood market selling live'
b'animals in Wuhan, where most '
b'f the earlier patients having'
b'pneu-monia had worked or visi'
b'ed, was recognized. However, '
b's the epidemic disease grew, '
b'erson-to-person transmission '
b'ecame the principal means of '
b'pread. COVID-19 infection is '
b'pread using large droplets pr'
b'duced during coughing and sne'
b'zing by symp-tomatic cases bu'
b' may also happen from asympto'
b'atic individuals before start'
b'ng of their symptoms (9). The'
b'e infected droplets can trave'
b' 1\xe2\x80\x932 meters and later put d'
b'wn on surfaces. Droplets nor '
b' mally do not extend more tha'
b' 2 meters and do not hang on '
b'n the air. The virus could st'
b'y viable on surfaces for days'
b'in desirable environmental co'
b'ditions but are ruined in les'
b' than a minute by regular dis'
b'nfectants, such as sodium hyp'
b'chlorite and hydrogen peroxid'
b' (10). SARS-CoV-2 is obtained'
b'either by breathing of the dr'
b'plets or touching surface tai'
b'ted by them and then touching'
b'the nose, mouth and eyes. Cas'
b's may be contagious for as lo'
b'g as the symptoms continue an'
b' even after clinical improvem'
b'nt. Moreover, certain cases m'
b'y behave as super-spreaders. '
b's said by a joint WHO-China s'
b'atement, the rate of secondar'
b' COVID-19 disease attack vari'
b'd from 1 to 5% among tens of '
b'housands of close contacts of'
b'verified cases in China (11).'
b'In the USA, the symptomatic s'
b'condary attack rate was 0.45%'
b'among 445 close contacts of 1'
b' verified cases (12). SARS-Co'
b'-2 RNA has been demonstrated '
b'n sputum, blood and stool sam'
b'les. However, fecal-oral, as '
b'ell as materno-fetal vertical'
b'transmission, have not been i'
b'entified as an important elem'

b'yClinical Features, Course an'
b' Complications of COVID-19 Di'
b'easeThe incubation period of '
b'ARS-CoV-2 infection is assume'
b' to be in 14 days succeeding '
b'xposure, with most patients t'
b'king place around four to fiv'
b' days (13). Individuals of al'
b' ages may acquire SARS-CoV-2 '
b'nfection, although middle age'
b'and older individuals are the'
b'majority. In some cohorts of '
b'ospitalized cases with con-fi'
b'med COVID-19 infection, the m'
b'dian age varied from 49 to 56'
b'years (14). The usual clinica'
b' characteristics involve feve'
b', dry cough, fatigue, sore th'
b'oat, rhinorrhea, conjunctivit'
b's headache, myalgia, dysp-nea'
b' nausea, vomiting and diarrhe'
b'. Hence, there are no unique '
b'linical features that yet dep'
b'ndably differentiate COVID-19'
b'from other upper/lower airway'
b'viral infections. In a subgro'
b'p of cases, by the end of the'
b'first week, COVID-19 may deve'
b'op to pneumo-nia, pulmonary f'
b'ilure and death (15). Pneumon'
b'a seems to be the most common'
b'severe manifestation of COVID'
b'19, distinguished mainly by f'
b'ver, dry cough, dyspnea, and '
b'ilateral infiltrates on chest'
b'imaging. The median time from'
b'the beginning of symptoms to '
b'yspnea was five days, hospita'
b'ization seven days and acute '
b'es-piratory distress syndrome'
b'(ARDS) eight days. Recovery b'
b'gins in the 2\nnd or 3rd week.'
b'According to the WHO, recover'
b' time appears to be roughly t'
b'o weeks for mild and three to'
b'six weeks for severe COVID-19'
b'disease (16). The median peri'
b'd of hospitalization in recov'
b'red cases was 10 days. Poor o'
b'tcomes and fatality are more '
b'ommon in the elderly than pat'
b'ents with co-morbidities (50\xe2'
b'\x9375% of a fatality).Even asym'
b'tomatic cases may have an obj'
b'ctive laboratory rather than '
b'linical abnormalities. In a s'
b'udy enrolling 24 patients wit'
b' asymptomatic COVID-19 infect'
b'on, all of whom underwent tho'
b'ax computed tomography (CT), '
b'0% had typical ground-glass o'
b'acities or patchy infiltratio'
b', and another 20% had atypica'
b' lung imaging pathology. Five'
b'out of 24 cases had a low-gra'
b'e fever, with or with-out oth'
b'r characteristic symptoms, a '
b'ew days after diagnosis (17).'
b'he clinical picture of COVID-'
b'9 disease, SARS-CoV-2 infecti'
b'n, is mostly not severe as fo'
b'lows:\xe2\x80\xa2 Asymptomatic (latent'
b' infection: Cases positively '
b'ested for SARS-CoV-2, but lac'
b'ing clinical symptoms or path'
b'logic lung imaging findings\xe2\x80'
b' Acute upper airway viral inf'
b'ction: Patients with only fev'
b'r, dry cough, pharyngeal pain'
b' nasal congestion/rhinorrhea,'
b'fatigue, headache, or myalgia'
b' and devoid of findings of pn'
b'umonia by thorax imaging or s'
b'psis.The scale of COVID-19 di'
b'ease is diverse, varying from'
b'clinically asymptomatic to AR'
b'S and multiorgan failure. The'
b'authors of the Chinese CDC re'
b'ort categorized the clinical '
b'ymptoms of the COVID-19 disea'
b'e by the severity:\xe2\x80\xa2 Mild di'
b'ease (e.g., with no/mild pneu'
b'onia) was described in 81%.\xe2\x80'
b' Severe disease (e.g., with d'
b'spnea, tachypnea: \xe2\x89\xa570 /min '
b'<1 year), \xe2\x89\xa550/min (\xe2\x89\xa51 yea'
b'), hypoxia (oxygen saturation'
b'<92%), or >50% pulmonary invo'
b'vement on imaging within 24 t'
b' 48 hours, disturbance of con'
b'ciousness and feeding difficu'
b'ty or food refusal, with sign'
b' of dehydration) was observed'
b'in 14%. \xe2\x80\xa2 Critical disease '
b'e.g., with respiratory collap'
b'e, shock, or multi-organ fail'
b're) was reported in 5% (18). '
b'n a study involving 138 patie'
b'ts, ARDS developed in 20% aft'
b'r a median of 8 days, and mec'
b'anical ventilation was requir'
b'd in 12.3%. Age higher than 6'
b' years, diabetes mellitus and'
b'hyperten-sion were each found'
b'to be related to ARDS (19). T'
b'e necessity for intensive car'
b' admittance was in 25\xe2\x80\x9330% o'
b' affected cases in previous r'
b'ported series (14). Complicat'
b'ons comprised acute lung inju'
b'y, ARDS, shock and acute kidn'
b'y injury (20). Others include'
b' arrhythmias and acute cardia'
b' injury. In one study, these '
b'omplica-tions were reported i'
b' 16.7% and 7.2%, respectively'
b'(15).The general fatality rat'
b' is expected to vary between '
b'% and 3%; no deaths were obse'
b'ved among noncritical cases. '
b'he mortality rate in admitted'
b'adult patients varied from 4%'
b'to 11% (18, 21). As said by a'
b'joint WHO-China fact-finding '
b'ission, the case-fatality rat'
b' ranged from 5.8% in Wuhan to'
b'0.7% in the rest of China (22'
b'. The proportion of fatal inf'
b'ctions may vary by location, '

b'temperature), dry cough, fati'
b'ue; ii-) with lung imaging fi'
b'dings; iii-) with normal or d'
b'creased leukocyte count, or d'
b'creased lymphocyte number dur'
b'ng the early phase of the COV'
b'D-19 infection; iv-) no other'
b'infectious agents are found, '
b'n-tirely explaining the sympt'
b'ms (26, 28).Confirmation of C'
b'VID-19 DiagnosisSuspected pat'
b'ents who have any one of the '
b'ext criteria: I.) Airway or b'
b'ood samples tested positive f'
b'r SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR; II'
b') Genetic sequencing of airwa'
b' or blood samples is extremel'
b' homologous with the identifi'
b'd SARS-CoV-2 genome (26, 29).'
b'aboratory Evaluation (RT-PCR '
b's. Serology)SARS-CoV-2 RNA is'
b'identified by RT-PCR. Samples'
b'from throat swabs (nasopharyn'
b'eal in children), sputum, low'
b'r airway secre-tions, stool a'
b'd blood could be checked for '
b'ARS-CoV-2 ribonu-cleic acids.'
b'Studies have demonstrated hig'
b'er viral loads in the nasal c'
b'vity as compared to the throa'
b' with no distinction in viral'
b'bur -den between symptomatic '
b'nd asymptomatic individuals ('
b'0). An oropharyngeal swab can'
b'be gathered, but is not cruci'
b'l; if gathered, it should be '
b'ut in the same container as t'
b'e nasopharyngeal swab specime'
b'. Negative RT-PCR results fro'
b' oropharyngeal swabs, regardl'
b'ss of CT findings indicative '
b'f viral pneumonia, have been '
b'emonstrated in certain cases '
b'hat ultimately shown to be po'
b'itive for SARS-CoV-2. The Ame'
b'ican CDC suggests a collectio'
b' of a nasopharyngeal swab to '
b'nalyze for SARS-CoV-2 (31). S'
b'utum should only be obtained '
b'rom cases with productive cou'
b'h; spu-tum induction is not a'
b'vised. If preliminary testing'
b'is negative, but the doubt fo'
b' COVID-19 persists, the WHO a'
b'vises recollection and analyz'
b'ng from several airway sites.'
b'Laboratory testing of the SAR'
b'-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid may r'
b'sult in false-negative result'
b', and serological analysis of'
b'virus-specific IgG and IgM an'
b'ibodies should be utilized as'
b'an option for diagnosis (32).'
b'Typical disease manifestation'
b' and radiological lung abnorm'
b'lities in a case with negativ'
b' four times RT-PCR tests for '
b'ARS-CoV-2 and positive IgG an'
b' IgM antibodies against the v'
b'rus were demonstrated (27). I'
b' has been earlier shown that '
b'ome SARS-CoV-2 infected cases'
b'are asymptomatic while RT-PCR'
b'tests are verified positive, '
b'nd some cases that improved f'
b'om COVID-19 disease may still'
b'have positive RT-PCR results '
b'uring follow-up.Additional la'
b'oratory tests, including CBC '
b'nd biochemistry, are generall'
b' nonspecific. The leukocyte c'
b'unt is frequently normal or l'
b'w. There might be lymphopenia'
b' a lymphocyte count <1.000 ha'
b' been related to severe disea'
b'e. The thrombocyte count is g'
b'nerally normal or slightly lo'
b'. Most cases show high CRP an'
b' ESR, but procalcitonin level'
b' are typically normal. An ele'
b'ated pro-calcitonin level may'
b'point to a bacterial co-infec'
b'ion. The ALT/AST, prothrombin'
b'time, creatinine, D-dimer, CP'
b', LDH, myohe-moglobin and fer'
b'itin levels might be increase'
b' and elevated levels might be'
b'related to severe disease (20'
b' 26, 33). On hospitalization,'
b'many cases having pneumonia h'
b've normal serum procalcitonin'
b'levels, but, in cases necessi'
b'ating intensive care unit (IC'
b') manage-ment, they are more '
b'ikely to be increased. Elevat'
b'd D-dimer levels and more sev'
b're lymphopenia have been show'
b' to be linked with fatality ('
b'4).The lung X-ray (CXR) gener'
b'lly shows bilateral infiltrat'
b'ons but may be normal in the '
b'arly phase of the disease. Th'
b' chest CT is more sensitive a'
b'd specific. Lung CT scans gen'
b'rally demonstrate infiltrates'
b' ground-glass opacities and s'
b'bsegmental consolidation. Les'
b' common abnormalities contain'
b'pleural effusion/thickening, '
b'nd lymphadenopathy. During th'
b' early phase of COVID-19 dise'
b'se, thorax CT shows multiple '
b'mall plaques and interstitial'
b'alterations, evident in the l'
b'ng periphery, further worsens'
b'to bi-lateral multiple ground'
b'glass opacity and/or infiltra'
b'ing shadows. Pulmonary consol'
b'dation may happen in severe c'
b'ses. Pleural effu-sion is inf'
b'equently observed (26, 34). P'
b'thologic lung CT imaging has '
b'lso been utilized to identify'
b'COVID-19 in suspected and/or '
b'symptomatic cases with negati'
b'e RT-PCR; many of them become'
b'to have positive PCR when the'
b' are repeated (35).TreatmentS'
b'pportive TherapyTreatment is '
b'asically supportive and sympt'
b'matic. The first step is to g'
b'arantee sufficient isolation '
b'o stop spread for other conta'
b'ted individuals, cases and he'

b'ture exceeding 38.5\xc2\xb0C with n'
b'ticeable distress, bodily coo'
b'ing (such as lukewarm water b'
b'th, antipyretic patches) or a'
b'-tipyretic medicine therapy w'
b'uld be given. Frequent medica'
b'ions involve: acetaminophen o'
b'ally, 10\xe2\x80\x9315 mg/kg, 4-6 time'
b'/day (ibuprofen is recommende'
b' to avoid). Routine use of an'
b'ibiotics and antivirals, such'
b'as oseltamivir, should be kep'
b' away from veri-fied patients'
b'(26).In hypoxic individuals, '
b'xygen therapy through nasal p'
b'ongs, face mask, high flow na'
b'al cannula or non-invasive ve'
b'tilation may be required. Mec'
b'anical ventilation and even e'
b'tra corporeal mem-brane oxyge'
b' (ECMO) treatment might be co'
b'sidered necessary. Children w'
b'o go through non-invasive mec'
b'anical ventilation for two ho'
b'rs without any progress, or c'
b'nnot put up with non-inva-siv'
b' ventilation, with augmented '
b'irway secretions, severe coug'
b', or hemodynamic unpredictabi'
b'ity, should rapidly undergo m'
b'chan-ical ventilation. If req'
b'ired, prone position ventilat'
b'on, pulmonary recruitment, or'
b'ECMO can be utilized (37). Re'
b'al replacement treatment may '
b'e required in certain cases ('
b'6, 37).Antiviral TherapyThere'
b'has not been, currently, yet '
b'idely accepted therapeutic op'
b'ion for COVID-19 disease. Ant'
b'viral drugs, such as ribaviri'
b', lopinavir-ritonavir, have b'
b'en tried depend on the anecdo'
b'al knowl-edge with HIV, SARS '
b'nd MERS infection therapies ('
b'6, 27).Lopinavir-ritonavir: T'
b'is combined protease inhibito'
b', which has mainly been utili'
b'ed for HIV infection. This co'
b'bination has shown to have an'
b'effect on the SARS-CoV infect'
b'on in vitro and some ac-tivit'
b' against MERS-CoV in animals '
b'38). In a study, including fi'
b'e cases treated with lopinavi'
b'-ritonavir, three cases recov'
b'red and two cases worsened; f'
b'ur cases of them had gastroin'
b'estinal side effects. Lopinav'
b'r/ritonavir combination has b'
b'en currently tried in the tre'
b'tment of adult SARS-CoV-2 pat'
b'ents with pneumonia, but its '
b'fficacy and safety wait to be'
b'defined (39).Ribavirin: In a '
b'ast control study in SARS, ca'
b'es treated with lopinavir-rit'
b'navir with ribavirin had bett'
b'r results when compared to th'
b' cases used ribavirin only (4'
b').Remdesivir: Remdesivir is a'
b'new nucleotide analogue that '
b'as effects against SARS-CoV-2'
b'in vitro and linked coronavir'
b'ses (in-cluding SARS and MERS'
b'CoV) both in vitro and in ani'
b'al studies (41). Many randomi'
b'ed clinical trials are ongoin'
b' to assess the sup-portive us'
b' of remdesivir efficacy in mo'
b'est or severe COVID-19 infect'
b'on and any clinical effects o'
b' remdesivir on COVID-19 stay '
b'urrently unidentified. There '
b's anecdotal practice with the'
b'utiliza-tion of remdesivir, a'
b'wide spectrum anti-RNA medica'
b'ion previ-ously used for Ebol'
b' in COVID-19 treatment (42).A'
b'bidol, oseltamivir and other '
b'ntiviral drugs: Arbidol, an a'
b'tiviral drug available in Rus'
b'ia and China, is used for adu'
b't SARS-CoV-2 infection; yet, '
b'ts efficacy and safety stay u'
b'certain (27, 43). A combinati'
b'n with oseltamivir and other '
b'nti-influenza medications may'
b'be required for coinfections '
b'ith Influenza A/B. The other '
b'n-tiviral medications evolvin'
b' daily but now comprise nitaz'
b'xanide, favipiravir, nafamost'
b't, and so on (40).Chloroquine'
b'hydroxychloroquine: Both chlo'
b'oquine and hy-droxychloroquin'
b' hamper SARSCoV-2 replication'
b'in vitro, even though hydroxy'
b'hloroquine seems to have a mo'
b'e powerful an-tiviral effect '
b'41, 44).Other DrugsSuggested '
b'rugs for immunotherapy are in'
b'ravenous immunoglob-ulin (IVI'
b'), interferons, and convalesc'
b'nt immune plasma of im-proved'
b'cases from COVID-19 disease.I'
b'travenous immunoglobulin can '
b'e utilized in severe COVID-19'
b'disease when required, but it'
b' efficacy remains uncertain a'
b'd needs further studies (26, '
b'7). The efficacy of IVIG coul'
b' be bet-ter if the IgG antibo'
b'ies were gathered from cases '
b'mproved from SARSCoV-2 infect'
b'on, to increase the probabili'
b'y of inactivating the virus. '
b'his is called as \xe2\x80\x98convalesc'
b'nt immune plasma\xe2\x80\x99 ther - ap'
b'. More specific IgG antibodie'
b' would be more effective agai'
b'st COVID-19 disease by enhanc'
b'ng the immune response in inf'
b'cted cases (37, 45). Conseque'
b'tly, immunotherapy with speci'
b'ic IgG antibodies along with '
b'ntiviral drugs can be an alte'
b'native therapy against COVID-'
b'9 disease until better choice'
b', such as a vaccine, are acce'
b'sible. For the first time tha'
b' a SARS-CoV-specific hu-man m'
b'noclonal antibody, CR3022, ha'
b' been recently reported to be'
b'able to potently attach with '
b'ARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding do'
b'ain. Potent binding of SARSCo'
b'-2 spike protein by a SARS-Co'
b' specific human monoclonal an'
b'ibody could be an alternative'
b'therapeutic approach in the n'
b'ar future (46).Interferon (IF'
b')-\xce\xb1 can decrease viral load '
b'uring the early stage of COVI'
b'-19 disease, and it can help '
b'o improve disease manifesta-t'
b'ons and curtail the course of'

b'kinra is one of the interleuk'

b'sed in clinical trials (49).A'
b'tibiotics and/or antifungals '

b'such as Mycoplasma and Chlamy'
b'ia, are suspected or proven. '
b'rolonged macrolide therapy, a'
b' a modulator of immune functi'
b'n, is being evaluated (27).An'
b'i-parasitic medication Iverme'
b'tin was demonstrated to inhib'
b't the replication of SARS-CoV'
b'2 in vitro. Ivermectin was pr'
b'viously found to have broad- '

b'mectin seems to require furth'
b'r research on possible benefi'
b's in COVID-19 disease (50).Gl'
b'cocorticoids: Steroids have b'
b'en related to a higher risk f'
b'r fa-tality in influenza pati'
b'nts and postponed viral clear'
b'nce in MERS-CoV infected pati'
b'nts. Although glucocorticoids'
b'were broadly uti-lized in the'
b'therapy of SARS, there has be'
b'n no good quality proof for a'
b'vantage, and there was convin'
b'ing data of short- and long-t'
b'rm adverse effects. The role '
b'f steroids is unverified and '
b'ight have a partial role whil'
b' existing international conse'
b'sus advises against their uti'
b'ization. The WHO/CDC advises '
b'hem not to be given in COVID-'
b'9 disease with pneumonia exce'
b't for there are other indicat'
b'ons (e.g., exacerbation of th'
b' chronic obstructive pul-mona'
b'y disease and asthma) (26, 27'
b' 51). Chinese guidelines also'
b'advocate short term therapy w'
b'th low-to-moderate dose stero'
b'ds for ARDS complications of '
b'OVID-19 disease (52). The uti'
b'ization of corticosteroids sh'
b'uld depend on the severity of'
b'hyperinflamma-tory response, '
b'he extent of dyspnea, with or'
b'without ARDS, and the advance'
b'ent of lung imaging status. C'
b'rticosteroids can be administ'
b'red in a short period of time'
b'(3\xe2\x80\x937 days). The suggested d'
b'se of methylprednisolone shou'
b'd not surpass 1\xe2\x80\x932 mg/kg/day'
b'\nCONCLUSION\nThe COVID-19 dise'
b'se should be mostly thought i'
b' cases with fever and/or airw'
b'y manifestations that have ha'
b' contact with a verified/susp'
b'cted case. Upon suspicion of '
b'OVID-19 disease, in-fection c'
b'ntrol actions should be execu'
b'ed and public health official'
b' visited (53). Besides testin'
b' for other respiratory viral '
b'athogens, a nasopharyngeal sw'
b'b should be sent for RT-PCR t'
b'sting. Man-agement basically '
b'onsists of palliative care. H'
b'me care may be likely for cas'
b's with a mild disease that ca'
b' be sufficiently isolated. To'
b'decrease the danger of spread'
b'in society, people should be '
b'dvised to wash hands assiduou'
b'ly, carry out respiratory hyg'
b'ene, and keep away from crowd'
b' and close contact with sick '
b'ndividuals. Facemasks are not'
b'regularly suggested for asymp'
b'omatic cases, but social dist'
b'ncing is advised in every pla'
b'e that has society spread.\nPe'
