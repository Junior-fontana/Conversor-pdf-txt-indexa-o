b'Dear Editor,The outbreak of c'
b'ronavirus disease 2019 (COVID'
b'19)caused by the severe acute'
b'respiratory syndrome cor-onav'
b'rus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) '
b'oses a seriousthreat to globa'
b' public health and local econ'
b'mies. As ofMarch 3, 2020, ove'
b' 80,000 cases have been con \xef'
b'\x81rmed in China, including 294'
b' deaths as well as over 10,56'
b'con\xef\xac\x81rmed cases in 72 other '
b'ountries. Such huge num-bers '
b'f infected and dead people ca'
b'l for an urgentdemand of effe'
b'tive, available, and affordab'
b'e drugs tocontrol and diminis'
b' the epidemic.We have recentl'
b' reported that two drugs, rem'
b'esivir(GS-5734) and chloroqui'
b'e (CQ) phosphate, ef \xef\xac\x81cient'
b'y inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infect'
b'on in vitro\n1. Remdesivir is '
b' nucleoside analog prodrug de'
b'eloped by Gilead Sciences(USA'
b'. A recent case report showed'
b'that treatment withremdesivir'
b'improved the clinical conditi'
b'n of the \xef\xac\x81rst patient infec'
b'ed by SARS-CoV-2 in the Unite'
b' States\n2, and a phase III cl'
b'nical trial of remdesivir aga'
b'nst SARS-CoV-2 was launched i'
b' Wuhan on February 4, 2020.Ho'
b'ever, as an experimental drug'
b' remdesivir is notexpected to'
b'be largely available for trea'
b'ing a very largenumber of pat'
b'ents in a timely manner. Ther'
b'fore, of thetwo potential dru'
b's, CQ appears to be the drug '
b'f choicefor large-scale use d'
b'e to its availability, proven'
b'safetyrecord, and a relativel'
b' low cost. In light of the pr'
b'-liminary clinical data, CQ h'
b's been added to the list oftr'
b'al drugs in the Guidelines fo'
b' the Diagnosis andTreatment o'
b' COVID-19 (sixth edition) pub'
b'ished byNational Health Commi'
b'sion of the People \xe2\x80\x99s Repub'
b'ic of China.CQ (N4-(7-Chloro-'
b'-quinolinyl)-N1,N1-diethyl-1,'
b'-pentanediamine) has long bee'
b' used to treat malaria andame'
b'iasis. However,Plasmodium fal'
b'iparumdeveloped widespread re'
b'istance to it, and with the d'
b'velopment ofnew antimalarials'
b' it has become a choice for t'
b'e pro-phylaxis of malaria. In'
b'addition, an overdose of CQ c'
b'ncause acute poisoning and de'
b'th3. In the past years, due t'
b' infrequent utilization of CQ'
b'in clinical practice, its pro'
b'duction and market supply was'
b'greatly reduced, at least inC'
b'ina. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)'
b'sulfate, a derivative ofCQ, w'
b's\xef\xac\x81rst synthesized in 1946 b'
b' introducing ahydroxyl group '
b'nto CQ and was demonstrated t'
b' bemuch less (~40%) toxic tha'
b' CQ in animals\n4. More import'
b'ntly, HCQ is still widely ava'
b'lable to treat auto-immune di'
b'eases, such as systemic lupus'
b'erythematosusand rheumatoid a'
b'thritis. Since CQ and HCQ sha'
b'esimilar chemical structures '
b'nd mechanisms of acting as aw'
b'ak base and immunomodulator, '
b't is easy to conjure upthe id'
b'a that HCQ may be a potent ca'
b'didate to treatinfection by S'
b'RS-CoV-2. Actually, as of Feb'
b'uary 23,2020, seven clinical '

b'2 infection still lacks theex'
b'erimental evidence.To this en'
b', we evaluated the antiviral '
b'ffect of HCQagainst SARS-CoV-'

b'cytotoxic concentration (CC 5'

b'3.20 and 249.50 \xce\xbcM, respecti'
b'ely, which are not signi\xef\xac\x81ca'
b'tly different from each other'
b'(Fig. 1a). To better compare '
b'he antiviral activity of CQ v'
b'rsus HCQ,the dose\xe2\x80\x93response '
b'urves of the two compounds ag'

b' at four different multi-plic'
b'ties of infection (MOIs) by q'
b'anti \xef\xac\x81cation of viral RNA c'
b'py numbers in the cell supern'
b'tant at 48 h postinfection (p'
b'i.). The data summarized in F'
b'g. 1a and Supplementary Table'
b'S1 show that, at all MOIs (0.'
b'1,0.02, 0.2, and 0.8), the 50'
b' maximal effective concentra-'
b'ion (EC\n50) for CQ (2.71, 3.8'
b', 7.14, and 7.36 \xce\xbcM) was low'
b'r than that of HCQ (4.51, 4.0'
b', 17.31, and 12.96 \xce\xbcM). The '
b'ifferences in EC\n50values wer'
b' statistically signi\xef\xac\x81cant a'
b' an MOI of 0.01 (P< 0.05) and'
b'MOI of 0.2 (P< 0.001) (Supple'
b'entary Table S1). It is worth'
b'noting that theEC\n50values of'
b'CQ seemed to be a little high'
b'r than that inour previous re'
b'ort (1.13\xce\xbcM at an MOI of 0.0'
b')\n1, which is likely due to t'
b'e adaptation of the virus in '
b'ell culturethat signi\xef\xac\x81cantl'
b' increased viral infectivity '
b'pon con-tinuous passaging. Co'
b'sequently, the selectivity in'
b'ex(SI=CC\n50/EC 50) of CQ (100'
b'81, 71.71, 38.26, and 37.12)w'
b's higher than that of HCQ (55'
b'32, 61.45, 14.41, 19.25)at MO'
b's of 0.01, 0.02, 0.2, and 0.8'
b' respectively. Theseresults w'
b're corroborated by immuno \xef\xac\x82'
b'orescence microscopy as evide'
b'ced by different expression l'
b'vels ofvirus nucleoprotein (N'
b') at the indicated drug con-c'
b'ntrations at 48 h p.i. (Suppl'
b'mentary Fig. S1). Takentogeth'
b'r, the data suggest that the '
b'nti-SARS-CoV-2activity of HCQ'
b'seems to be less potent compa'
b'ed to CQ,at least at certain '
b'OIs.Both CQ and HCQ are weak '
b'ases that are known toelevate'
b'the pH of acidic intracellula'
b' organelles, such asendosomes'
b'lysosomes, essential for memb'
b'ane fusion\n5.I n addition, CQ'
b'could inhibit SARS-CoV entry '
b'hroughchanging the glycosylat'
b'on of ACE2 receptor and spike'
b'rotein\n6. Time-of-addition ex'
b'eriment con \xef\xac\x81rmed that HCQ '
b'ffectively inhibited the entr'
b' step, as well as thepost-ent'
b'y stages of SARS-CoV-2, which'
b'was also foundupon CQ treatme'
b't (Supplementary Fig. S2). To'
b'furtherexplore the detailed m'
b'chanism of action of CQ and H'
b'Qin inhibiting virus entry, c'
b'-localization of virions with'
b'arly endosomes (EEs) or endol'
b'sosomes (ELs) was ana-lyzed b'
b' immuno\xef\xac\x82uorescence analysis'
b'(IFA) and confocalmicroscopy.'
b'Quanti\xef\xac\x81cation analysis show'
b'd that, at90 min p.i. in untr'
b'ated cells, 16.2% of internal'
b'zed virions(anti-NP, red) wer'
b' observed in early endosome a'
b'tigen 1(EEA1)-positive EEs (g'
b'een), while more virions (34.'
b'%)were transported into the l'
b'te endosomal \xe2\x80\x93lysosomal pro'
b'ein LAMP1+ELs (green) (n> 30 '
b'ells for each group). By cont'
b'ast, in the presence of CQ or'
b'HCQ, signi \xef\xac\x81cantly more vir'
b'ons (35.3% for CQ and 29.2% f'
b'r HCQ; P< 0.001) were detecte'
b' in the EEs, while only very '
b'ew vir-ions (2.4% for CQ and '
b'.03% for HCQ; P< 0.001) were '
b'ound to be co-localized with '
b'AMP1\n+ELs (n> 30 cells) (Fig.'
b'b, c). This suggested that bo'
b'h CQ and HCQblocked the trans'
b'ort of SARS-CoV-2 from EEs to'
b'ELs,which appears to be a req'
b'irement to release the viralg'
b'nome as in the case of SARS-C'
b'V\n7. Interestingly, we found '
b'hat CQ and HCQ treatmentcause'
b' noticeable changes in the nu'
b'ber and size/mor-phology of E'
b's and ELs (Fig.1c). In the un'
b'reated cells, most EEs were m'
b'ch smaller than ELs (Fig. 1c)'
b' In CQ- and HCQ-treated cells'
b' abnormally enlarged EE vesic'
b'eswere observed (Fig.1c, arro'
b's in the upper panels), manyo'
b' which are even larger than E'
b's in the untreated cells.This'
b'is in agreement with previous'
b'report that treatmentwith CQ '
b'nduced the formation of expan'
b'ed cytoplasmicvesicles\n8. Wit'
b'in the EE vesicles, virions ('
b'ed) were loca-lized around th'
b' membrane (green) of the vesi'
b'le. CQtreatment did not cause'
b'obvious changes in the number'
b'nd size of ELs; however, the '
b'egular vesicle structureseeme'
b' to be disrupted, at least pa'
b'tially. By contrast, inHCQ-tr'
b'ated cells, the size and numb'
b'r of ELs increasedsigni\xef\xac\x81can'
b'ly (Fig.1c, arrows in the low'
b'r panels).Since acidi\xef\xac\x81catio'
b' is crucial for endosome matu'
b'ationand function, we surmise'
b'that endosome maturationmight'
b'be blocked at intermediate st'
b'ges of endocytosis,resulting '

b'ge, there is a lack of studie'
b' on the impact ofHCQ on the m'
b'rphology and pH values of end'
b'somes/lysosomes. Our observat'
b'ons suggested that the mode o'
b'actions of CQ and HCQ appear '
b'o be distinct in certainaspec'
b's.It has been reported that o'
b'al absorption of CQ andHCQ in'
b'humans is very ef\xef\xac\x81cient. In'
b'animals, both drugsshare simi'

b'ted that safe dosage (6 \xe2\x80\x936.'
b' mg/kg per day) of HCQ sulfat'
b' could generate serum levels '
b'f 1.4 \xe2\x80\x931.5\xce\xbcMi n humans\n11.'
b'Therefore, with a safe dosage'
b' HCQ con-centration in the ab'
b've tissues is likely to be ac'
b'ieved toinhibit SARS-CoV-2 in'
b'ection.Clinical investigation'
b'found that high concentration'
b'ofcytokines were detected in '
b'he plasma of critically illpa'
b'ients infected with SARS-CoV-'
b', suggesting thatcytokine sto'
b'm was associated with disease'
b'severity\n12. Other than its d'
b'rect antiviral activity, HCQ '
b's a safe andsuccessful anti-i'
b'\xef\xac\x82ammatory agent that has be'
b'n usedextensively in autoimmu'
b'e diseases and can signi \xef\xac\x81c'
b'ntly decrease the production '
b'f cytokines and, in particula'
b',pro-in\xef\xac\x82ammatory factors. T'
b'erefore, in COVID-19patients,'
b'HCQ may also contribute to at'
b'enuating thein\xef\xac\x82ammatory res'
b'onse. In conclusion, our resu'
b'ts showthat HCQ can ef\xef\xac\x81cien'
b'ly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infecti'
b'nin vitro. In combination wit'
b' its anti-in \xef\xac\x82ammatory func'
b' tion, we predict that the dr'
b'g has a good potential tocomb'
b't the disease. This possibili'
b'y awaits con \xef\xac\x81rmation by cl'
b'nical trials. We need to poin'
b' out, although HCQ is lesstox'
b'c than CQ, prolonged and over'
b'ose usage can stillcause pois'
b'ning. And the relatively low '
